        In order to practice my UI/ UX design skills and to make the programming process easier, I created this Figma before I started programming the website. Once I completed the design, programming was quite simple since I knew how the user was going to interact with the site, how I wanted everything to be laid out, and did not need to make any more design choices while coding.

        I used coolors.co to help me choose a color palette. I wanted the website to have earthy and natural tones, to create a calming environment for the users. I wanted a clean design, so I decided to use a grid layout for all of the results, and I put a divider between the results and the top “filter” section. I chose the font combination Lora and Nunito because I like the way these serif and sans-serif fonts work together. Lora has a very elegant feel because of the serifs, and Nunito has a softer feel because it is a sans-serif font and its edges are rounded off. Overall, I think the design choices I made successfully portray a clean and neat design, that displays the content in a visually pleasing and calming way.

        This Figma is a redesign of a project I have already completed. The original design was not ideal and was rushed due to time constraints. The original design was adequate for the time being but needed to be redone. It fell short on delivering aesthetically pleasing visuals for the users and providing a thorough and easily navigable user experience.
        
        This new design is much more cohesive, enticing, visually appealing, and has a better user experience. There is much more thought that went into this color palette, the data display, user interaction, and the flow of pages. While the redesign contains the exact same information as the original design, the way that the data is displayed is more thought out.
        
        The page with the starkest change is the landing page. The content is the exact same in the original design and the redesign however the new design has pleasing illustrations that connect to the context. This helps to not only make the page aesthetically pleasing but also helps to spread out the text. The alignment of the text and the spacing are much different as well. In the new design, none of the text stretches across the whole page. It is in much smaller sections which help with readability. The design also uses a new color palette, and the bright orange color is used to reinforce the visual hierarchy of the text. 
        
        Another big change with the redesign is the navbar style. All of the icons are of similar circular styles, which helps them to feel cohesive. There is also an added “marketplace” navbar button that brings the user to the listing page, whereas in the original design the navbar uses the “home” button to bring the users back to the listing page. There was no way to get back to the landing page in the original design, but adding the “marketplace” button left the logo button in the navbar to bring users back to the landing page in the redesign. 
        
        The rest of the pages are laid out very similarly, the redesign just utilizes the color palette to establish visual hierarchy better, spaces out the content better utilizes better alignment that separates text better, and resizes content so no one element overwhelms the user’s view.

        title: "Tosti Redesign Case Study",
        details: `Original Site: https://tosticafe.com/
         
        In an attempt to sharpen my design skills and to show off what I am capable of, I took on the task of doing a case study on the website of a local restaurant. The restaurant is called Tosti, and it is a restaurant in Hoboken, NJ. While the restaurant itself is nicely designed and organized, the website had many issues.
        
        One of the the first most shocking issue that occurs sitewide is the large gallery which is at the top of each page. On a mobile device/ smaller screen, the gallery is not too overpowering, however on a desktop screen the images stretch across the whole screen width. They are stretched to the point that the images are pixelated. Another issue with the gallery is that they are the same set of images on each page. Therefore, besides the navbar current page indication, the page itself does not show that the user has changed pages successfully. Especially on my laptop, where the screen size is smaller than many others, the only thing you can see is the gallery, and none of the content under it. So, it is not obvious to a user that they have changed pages.  Another sitewide issue that I noticed was the “to top” button. It functions fine, however, when it is on top of the footer, there is not enough contrast between the blue button and the light blue footer. For someone who has more trouble with color distinction, the button would not be very helpful to them. 
    
        The footer is filled with many issues. Firstly, I think the logo should be white like the text on the footer, rather than black. This would allow the logo to blend with the theming in the footer better. There is also a lot of empty space between the text. This space disconnects the titles to their corresponding content. Also, the spacing between information sections is inconsistent. The spacing between the “Location” section and “Follow Us” section is much less than the space between the “Follow Us” and “Contact Us” sections. On the desktop view, the “Follow Us” section is broken, and the icons to each social media platform are not listed. While they do appear on mobile view, the icons do not match the color palette of the site. They should be white and blue to blend with the theming. On the desktop view, the alignment of the logo and the information is off. They should center aligned horizontally, whereas right now the logo is lying higher than the text. The "Contact Us" information is also listed under the location information and not under “Contact Us” title. On mobile view, the telephone number does not have good contrast from the footer background color because the text becomes a link, therefore the text becomes blue. Also on mobile view, the logo is center aligned while the text is left aligned. It would be more orgaized and aesthetically pleasing if all of the content was center aligned vertically. The "Contact Us" title is also unknowingly a button, that when clicked brings the user to the "Contact Us" page. There is no indication that it is a button and there is are no other buttons in the footer that bring the user to another page.
    
        The navbar has a lot of good features about it, especially with its adaptiveness to different screen sizing. On the mobile view, the navbar turns into a drop down menu, which is good, however when the content opens up, it moves all of the content on the main page down. Also, the on page indication does not have enough contrast to regular font and color. Since the font is smaller on mobile view, it is important that the on page indication is obvious. Another detail I thought should be changed is the navbar hover action. I think that their navbar hover style should differ from their on page style. An issue with the navbar on both desktop and mobile view is that if a user clicks on the menu tab, it opens up a long pdf of the whole menu. I don't think the menu tab should be a drop down if you can also click on it to view the entire menu. I think it would be better to have a separate button in the drop down that opens up the enitre menu, if they still wanted to provide that information.
        
        The homepage provides no information to the users. The home page just has two separate galleries and no other content. I think this is redundant and unnecessary because having two galleries does not have any functionality. There is also an excessive amount of empty space on the home page. I think there should be some text to welcome users to the site that can fill that empty space. Also, the dot navigation for the bottom gallery is on the border of the footer. This makes it very easy to miss, which is not good because the user is supposed to be able to interact with it to slide the gallery to another page. Any user interaction should be very obvious.
    
        On the about us page, the image cards are way too big. Also, there is no purpose to have that top gallery and also image cards underneath it. The drop shadow on the one image card  is unnecessary because nothing else on the site has a drop shadow, including the other two image cards on that same page. It is also very intense and overwhelming. The image cards also move when the mouse is hovering over them, which would indicate to users that you can click on them however, you cannot. This is misleading to the user and is an unnecessary animation. The text spacing is odd, because there is too much vertical spacing between the top “paragraph”. I think that the top “paragraph” is supposed to be a title, which is why it is bold, but it is too long to be a title. It is too much text to emphasize with the boldness. The image/ icon leaf on top of text is unnecessary, because it is not adding any context and seems irrelevant. 
    
        On the contact page, the map is too large. It should not be the first thing the users see before the information about the restaurant. On a desktop, the map and the hours card are not aligned. The bottom of the cards do not line up. Also, the text on the hours card is white, which makes it illegible on top of the image they've chosen. The hours information on the card and in the information section are the same, so there is not need to have it twice in the same section of the same page. It is repetitive. The vertical spacing between the text is too large as well and does not connect any titles to their content. All text is left aligned besides the “Monday-Friday (9am-9pm)” text. This makes the text seem scattered and messy. It should all be left aligned or center aligned. There is also not enough textual distinction between the content and the titles. There needs to be a better visual hierarchy. On the desktop view, there are no icons or text under “Check Reviews On”.
        
        In order to better the design of the website, I did some research of other restaurant websites, and what features they typically include on each page.  I included 1 transitioning gallery of images in the hero section of the home page, which replaced the two that were originally on there. I also added a welcoming text in the hero section to introduce users to the site. I put a call to action “Order Now” button in the hero section as well so it is very prominent to users and draws their attention to it. I added other information on the home page that helps promote the popularness and high regard of the restaurant, like real quotes from customers that came from Yelp. Lastly, I added buttons to open all of the menus, so users can access the menu from both the navbar and the home page. 
        
        On the “About Us” page, I added 1 image of the restaurant front next to text about it. I included all of the same information that they did on their original “About Us” page, however I changed the layout, text sizing, and visual hierarchy. 
        
        On the “Contact Us” page, again I kept all of the same information but changed the layout, alignment,  the text spacing and size, sizing of the map, and visual hierarchy. 
        
        In the navbar, I separated the buttons based on purpose. The left ones are those that navigate to different pages. The right two are ones that open up information in new tabs. I also changed the hover style and on page style of the buttons so that they have better contrast. On the mobile view, I made the drop down menu slide out from the slide of the screen and cover the page underneath. 
        
        In the footer, I changed the logo to be white instead, so it matches the text. I also changed the spacing between the text, so that each title clearly has corresponding content. The spacing between the information sections is even and all of the content in the footer is horizontally center aligned. 
        
        I think the design choices I made help to portray the same feeling that the original website was trying to, however I think mine offers a better user experience.

        This Figma design is for a coffee shop app, where customers can log in/ sign up, favorite products, add products to their shopping cart, check out, browse the menu, and search the menu.

        This design utilizes Figma scroll prototyping and fixed elements when scrolling. I based my color palette on the color of coffee and earthy colors. I wanted the app to have a calming feel, so I used a lot of natural and rounded corners. I decided to put a bottom screen navigation bar because that is the area of the screen that smartphone users interact with the most.
