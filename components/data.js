The original design and was okay for the time being, but needed to be redone. It fell short on delivering aesthetically pleasing visuals for the users and providing a thorough and easily navigatable user experience.
        
        This new design it much more cohesive, enticing, visually appealling, and has a better user experience. There is much more thought that went into this color pallette, the data display, user interaction, and the flow of pages.`,
